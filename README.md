# Simulation for a tendon driven Robot: Roboy in MuJoCo

### Setup
- The code runs in a docker environment to ensure optimal compatibility.

Build the docker environment:
- ./scripts/setup.sh

After the setup completed, a terminal in the docker container can be started with:
- ./scripts/start.sh

### Running the simulation
before the simulation can be started, roscore must be run.
To do so, use 
- ./code/src/ros.sh
from within a docker terminal

Now the simulation can be started in a docker terminal using 
- python3 /code/src/simulation.py

running it with the --help flag delivers information on how to use the program correctly:
- python3 /code/src/simulation.py --help

logfiles and plots are generated in /code/src/logfiles

### Iterating over arguments
To ease the process of finding the best parameters, the program has been written to allow automated follow up executions without user intervention.
- ./code/src/runForParameters.sh

can be used for this purpose.

### Additional plotting
simulation.py can be run with the --plot flag to automatically generate plots after the bagfile execution has been finished.

If one decided against that and only created a logfile using --log RATE, the generated logfile can later be plotted using:

- python3 /code/src/plot_only.py  LOGFILE, START[s], END[s]

### Fixing user privileges
files generated by the docker container can be owned by the user with the command:
- sudo chown USERNAME PATH/mujoco_roboy/src/logfiles -R
